CG-drawing started long, long, looong ago. Now trying to finish with new skills

This CG-drawing started something around 2018, but I didn't have enough skills that time to finish it and stopped at the hair-drawing point.

# Now: 
finished drawing hair, made a colour-base of frame. Also has some steps of drawing into png - just for fun.
make a sketch coloring of face - need to put lights and maybe more details.

# Struggles: drawing metal frame.
**ToDo:**
1. Make a metal frame
2. Draw eye-framing (like lashes of something)
3. Think about lips
4. Add lights and color to the face

5. Correct colors in general
6. Post-effects (like the strain of light from the upper-left corner and ets, ets)

**Current stage:**
