CG-drawing started long, long, looong ago. Now trying to finish with new skills

This CG-drawing started something around 2018, but I didn't have enough skills that time to finish it and stopped at the hair-drawing point.

This is a new experience for me, and I'm still trying to find the style. It's a bit hard for me to keep one way of coloring and rendering different parts of this work.
But presumably my wishes on this project are to make a warm-coloured, nice textured illustration of cuteness.

Guess after finishing this one piece of art I will choose another big illustration to work out fine pipe-lines for style which I tend to use most frequently.

# Now: 
finished drawing hair, made a colour-base of frame. Also has some steps of drawing into png - just for fun.
make a sketch coloring of face - need to put lights and maybe more details.

# Struggles: drawing metal frame.
**ToDo:**
1. Make a metal frame
2. Draw eye-framing (like lashes of something)
3. Think about lips
4. Add lights and color to the face

5. Correct colors in general
6. Post-effects (like the strain of light from the upper-left corner and ets, ets)

**Current stage:**
